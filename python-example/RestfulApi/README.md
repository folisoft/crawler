This is a small web project that queries a database of stock price that was obtained by a webcrawl on 
yahoo finance. The user gets a choice of which stock he/she would like to graph.
The server returns the stock prices and times and displays a d3 line graph over time. Nothing fancy just the basics
The canvas link serves a canvas javascript of a brickwall being built then a clock is displayed
with the current time. The clock speeds up and recesses into the wall. Then the scene is changed
to a storm over an ocean which breaks up to sunshine. Then it breaks to a screen of binary code.
The theme of the website is Builder, Dreamer, Coder. Ps I once was a bricklayer, then I went back to 
school while working in the retail business. I dreamt of getting into Physics, but got pulled into
actuary and passed the P and Fm exams. A recent change with the SOA accreditation process brought a storm to 
my future but I put my head down and studied my other skill that I picked up in college. Coding. Get it
Builder, Dreamer, Coder :) PPs I am working on the home and exploratory link. Not a completed site with style.
